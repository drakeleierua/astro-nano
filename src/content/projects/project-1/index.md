I worked on transforming [DemiCup](https://demicup.com)'s digital storefront by developing custom e-commerce solutions that streamlined product uploads and enhanced client engagement. My contributions included:

- **Optimizing Workflow:** Manually uploaded and organized products, saving over **$20,000** in third-party fees.
- **Enhanced User Experience:** Created high-quality product descriptions and sourced professional images, improving navigation and online sales flow.
- **Data-Driven Strategy:** Built a Python-based sentiment analysis tool to interpret client feedback and refine marketing approaches.

This project showcases my ability to combine **technical expertise** and **business strategy** to deliver tangible cost savings and an improved digital presence.
