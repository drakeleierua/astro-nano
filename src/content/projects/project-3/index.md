Built with React, Electron, TypeScript, and OpenAI‚Äôs API, **GhostSolve** is a stealth-mode coding assistant designed for high-pressure environments like technical interviews. The tool operates completely invisibly in the background‚Äîundetectable to screen recording, screen sharing, or remote monitoring software‚Äîoffering developers instant solutions to data structures and algorithms (DSA) problems in real time.

GhostSolve is engineered for job seekers who want to navigate the interview gauntlet without grinding LeetCode for months. It features multi-language support, contextual problem-solving, and shortcut-driven commands for quick screenshots, solution generation, and environment resets.

**What Makes GhostSolve Different:**  
Unlike browser-based plugins or risky screen overlays, GhostSolve is a fully local, native desktop application. That means no web detection, no plugin conflicts, and no accidental exposure. It‚Äôs hacker-grade performance for interview survival.

**Key Features:**
- **Undetectable Operation:** Invisible to all screen-recording or remote desktop software
- **Real-Time AI Help:** Instantly get OpenAI-generated code suggestions for DSA problems
- **Multi-Language Support:** Works with Python, Java, JavaScript, C++, Go, Rust, and more
- **Shortcut-Based Interface:** Trigger actions like screenshot analysis and solution display without ever touching your mouse
- **Custom Configuration:** Easily set your preferred language and OpenAI key through a clean config UI

**The Vision:**  
GhostSolve is about leveling the playing field for developers. Not everyone has the time or resources to grind 500 LeetCode problems before landing a job. This tool exists to help smart, capable people get hired faster‚Äîwithout being judged solely by memorized patterns.

This project is actively maintained and open-source. Contributions are welcome, and stars are appreciated ‚≠êÔ∏è.
