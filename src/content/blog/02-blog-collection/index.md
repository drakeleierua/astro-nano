One of the proudest moments in my journey through cybersecurity was when I got my first contribution published. It all started with MGT 488: Cybersecurity Strategy, a course that challenged me to dig deep into real-world cybersecurity problems and develop actionable strategies. Taught by Dr. Paul Drnevich, this class pushed us to think critically about everything from risk management to responding to live cyber threats.

For the final project, we were thrown into a case competition where my team had to develop a comprehensive response plan for a major retailer’s cybersecurity issues. Under the mentorship of Kevin McKenzie, we created a plan that analyzed vulnerabilities in the retail sector and proposed strategies to mitigate them. Our hard work earned us second place in the competition, but the real game-changer came after that.

Our team’s findings and strategies were published in the MGT488 Cybersecurity Strategy Teaching Note by the University of Alabama Press. It’s crazy to think that our work, including both the “How Retail is Fixing Vulnerabilities in Cybersecurity” and the “Response Plan,” is now part of the official curriculum.

Getting published in this way was a huge boost for my resume, and it showed me how impactful well-crafted cybersecurity strategies can be. Presenting to the Culverhouse College of Business Executive Cyber Advisory Board was one of the highlights of my academic career. The feedback we received was invaluable and provided the direction I need to push forward in my cybersecurity journey.
